=============

  Vendoring is the moving of all 3rd party items such as plugins, gems
  and even rails into the /vendor directory. This is one method for
  ensuring that all files are deployed to the production server the same
  as the dev environment.

While vendoring is generally frowned upon over here at OSSO, we also
frown upon dependency bloat.

Here are some files that do not fit in a project of its own yet.
